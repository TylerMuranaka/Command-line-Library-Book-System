# Command-line-Library-Book-System
Introduction
The Book Library System is a simple, easy-to-use program that allows you to manage a collection of books. You can add books to the collection, remove them, and search for books by their title or author.

System Requirements
This program is a standalone executable, compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It doesn't require any specific system prerequisites to run.

Getting Started
To run the program, simply double-click on the executable file (library_book_system.exe for Windows, appropriate variants for MacOS and Linux) in the program folder.

Managing the Database
The program automatically creates and maintains a database of your books. This database is stored in a file called books.db, which is located in the same folder as the program executable.

If you want to move the program to a different location on your system, make sure to move the entire folder, not just the executable file. This ensures that the books.db file stays with the program, and you don't lose any of your book data.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the Book Library System, please refer to the following tips:

If the program doesn't start, make sure that you have the appropriate permissions to run executable files in your system.
If your books aren't being saved, make sure that the books.db file is located in the same folder as the program executable. If the books.db file is missing, the program will create a new one, but any previously stored book data will not be included.
